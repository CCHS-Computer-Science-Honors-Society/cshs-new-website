          CSHS, or the Computer Science Honor Society, is a community of students at Cherry Creek High School who are dedicated to growing and excelling in computer science.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          Our goal is to bring together some of the smartest and most driven students to collaborate, solve problems, and push each other to become better computer scientists.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          We achieve this by working on projects together as a community and representing Creek in competitive programming events.
          Our primary project is <a class="underline" href="https://creekocw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCW (OpenCourseWare)</a>, a free educational website built entirely by students, with almost 2,000 users and thousands of views every month.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-muted-foreground">
          We meet once a week in the morning to work on OCW. As a member you will collaborate on either programming the platform, designing the platform, or writing for the platform.
